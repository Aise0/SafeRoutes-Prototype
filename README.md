## 📖 Introduction
[cite_start]The public and urban space involves various uncertainties and anxieties around safety, particularly for women who experience risks of harassment and attacks on a daily basis[cite: 1534, 1536]. [cite_start]**SafeRoutes** focuses on women's safety in Istanbul, providing a platform for solidarity and information exchange regarding different areas and routes in the city[cite: 1537].

[cite_start]By enabling users to rate street safety dynamically, we create an adaptive platform that communicates collective awareness through map-based visualizations, offering optimized safe routes for specific days and times[cite: 1539, 1540].
